**Fill in these details:**
1. **Repository name:** `CourseworkOS-Journal`
2. **Description:** `Operating Systems CMPN202 Technical Journal`
3. **Visibility:** ✅ **Public** (IMPORTANT - required for GitHub Pages!)
4. **DO NOT check** "Add a README file" (we already have one)
5. **DO NOT check** "Add .gitignore"
6. **DO NOT check** "Choose a license"
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions.

**Copy the HTTPS URL** that looks like:

```
