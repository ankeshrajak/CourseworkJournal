Assessment Requirements  
Introduction  
This coursework assesses your ability to configure, secure, and evaluate the performance of a 
Linux operating system. You will implement security controls, develop command -line 
proficiency through system administration tasks, and critically analyse operati ng system 
behaviour under different workloads.  
Data centres consume approximately 1% of global electricity, with projections reaching 3 -8% 
by 2030 [1]. Optimised OS configurations can reduce server energy consumption by 15 -30% 
through improved resource utilisation [2]. Understanding how to configure, s ecure, and 
evaluate operating systems is fundamental to computing practice.  
Assessment Overview  
You will configure a Linux server operating system running headless without a graphical 
interface. All system administration will be performed via command -line interface accessed 
through SSH from a separate workstation system. This enforces command -line pr oficiency 
whilst developing professional remote administration skills.  
Two Assessment Components  
Technical Journal (50% of the coursework mark).  Published on GitHub Pages documenting 
your work across all 7 weeks. This demonstrates progressive learning, technical 
implementation, and critical reflection.  
Recorded Demons tration (50% of the coursework mark).  A video (maximum 8 minutes)  
demonstrating  your work with live command -line demonstration showing your system and 
explaining your findings.  
System Architecture  
You will deploy two systems. The server system runs a Linux server distribution such as Ubuntu 
Server headless without desktop environment. You administer this system only via SSH using 
command -line tools. The workstation system provides your administrativ e access point. You 
may use a second Linux Desktop VM, your host machine with SSH client, or a hybrid approach.  
The dual -system architecture is a pedagogical constraint ensuring command -line proficiency. 
Your learning centres on operating system configuration, security implementation, and 
performance analysis rather than infrastructure design.  
Detailed system setup instructions are provided in Document 2: Technical Setup Guide.
